<h2><a class='underlink' href='../pdf/tsvar_newest.pdf'>“Crisis-Contingent Dynamics of Connectedness: An SVAR-Spatial-Network ‛Tripod’ Model with Thresholds” (Job Market Paper)</a></h2>
<p class='small'>In recent years a growing number of methodologies have been proposed to empirically measure the connectedness among financial entities. However, Few of them attempt to profile the <span class='stress'>dynamics</span> of the financial connectedness. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a novel and systematic model to portray not only the connectedness in a given regime but also its <span class='stress'>transitions</span> across different regimes. The model is based on an improved version of a “tripod” model, which unifies structural vector auto-regressions (SVARs), spatial models,  and network models under one framework. I introduce a transition mechanism into my model, thus making it possible to observe how the interconnections among financial entities vary with certain threshold variables. My model may be applied to various issues regarding the financial and non-financial interconnections among certain entities. As an illustration, I show how my model can shed some new light on the modeling of the recent Eurozone contagions. I reveal a clear causal map of the propagation of shocks among the stock markets in five selected Eurozone countries in both the contagion and non-contagion periods, which are determined automatically by a CDS index. I confirm the existence of contagion among the stock markets in these countries in recent years, and reject the hypothesis that the contagion is solely conducted by the cross-border interbank channel. And the unique roles played by each selected market under both the contagion and non-contagion regimes are efficiently summarized by network analyses. </p>

<p class='small'>Many economic analyses revolve around the impact of shocks. However, we are not always able to observe the variables causing and reacting to these shocks at a sufficiently high frequency. As a result, if the response of one variable to a shock to another takes place “in the nick of time,” this response remains intractable. We introduce a structural vector autoregression model with Markov-switching heteroskedasticity in the data generating process that allows us to study instantaneous impulse-response relationships with the proper selection of a supporting “catalyst,” which can be easier to find than an instrumental variable. Our method is especially useful for - but is in no way limited to - the study of financial markets, where information usually diffuses very quickly. In our application to the crude oil futures market, we find evidence that the inflow of index traders as contributed significantly to excess returns.</p>
<h2>“Destabilizing or Passive? The Impact of Commodity Index Traders on Equilibrium Prices”, with Jaap Bos and Paulo Rodrigues</h2>
<p class='small'>We study the behaviors of different classes of traders in commodity markets and their impacts on commodity prices. We find that positive feedback traders, whose existence can be reflected in the CFTC non-reportable long to total open interests, were linked to the price trends in commodity markets in recent years. And the commodity index traders also played an indispensable role in the in the determination of commodity prices, though in the different way from the `speculator--destabilizer' narrative, as we document that those index traders were likely to trade in a negative feedback way.</p>
