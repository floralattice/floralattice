<p>Chinese civilization starts from the exploration of the law of Heaven<sup><a class='inlink' href="#foot1" name='index1'>1</a></sup>, a supreme divinity that ancient Chinese people believed to rule the nature and human society. Heaven was believed to decide whether it would be rainy tomorrow, whether the yield of millet would be high for the next harvest, and even whether the king could continue ruling his kingdom. But the will of Heaven is just so unpredictable. Rulers were always concerned with the decisions of Heaven. What if Heaven decides that the king cannot rule any longer in the next morning, just like the rule of Shang dynasty - also known as “Yin” - was overthrown at the dawn of 20th January, 1046 BCE?<sup><a class='inlink' href="#foot2" name='index2'>2</a></sup> Rulers at that time could do little but hymn with fear:</p>
<div class='quote'>
<p>Heaven is not readily to be relied on;
</br>
It is not easy to be king.</p>
</div>
<p>Earliest intellectual class in the Chinese society arose from the diviners who tried to understand the law of Heaven, nature, and humanity by communicating with Heaven with ox scapulae and turtle plastrons. They would <span class='stress'>write</span><sup><a class='inlink' href="#foot3" name='index3'>3</a></sup> down their questions to Heaven with logograms on bones, heat the bones until cracked, judge the will of Heaven according to the pits, and then write the answer of Heaven down on the bones again with logograms. These logograms are later known as Chinese characters. Based on their judge of the will of Heaven, diviners were able to offer professional advice to their kings in all the aspects relevant to the current society.</p>
<p>But after hundreds of years' practice of bone-cracking, people gradually found that pits on oracle bones could not predict the decision of Heaven significantly. New methodologies must be created. After the historic failure for the House of Shang to maintain Heaven's favor and rule, the new ruler of China, King Wu of Zhou, announced his people's novel understanding of Heaven:</p>
<div class='quote'>
<p>Heaven sees as my people see; Heaven hears as my people hear.<sup><a class='inlink' href="#foot4" name='index4'>4</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>This is the first thought in the history of China to relate to the will of Heaven to the behaviors of the humanity. Hundreds of years later, following the idea of King Wu of Zhou, Confucianists raised an even stronger proposition:</p>
<div class='quote'>
<p>What Heaven has conferred is called The [Human] Nature.<sup><a class='inlink' href="#foot5" name='index5'>5</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p>Nowadays, we know clearly that the answer to such a question as “How is the weather decided?” is only to a small extent related to the human nature, despite there is global warming and other environmental problems caused by human activities. But if we ask “How is the yield of millet decided?,” the answer will be more related to human behaviors, since farmers' operations are affected by many social factors such as the price of millet as well as the risk. Moreover, whether a government can rule well or not is to an even more extent an issue of humanity. If there were really a “Heaven” that decided the patterns of the human society, the best tool to study the law of this “Heaven” we know today is social science, which is eventually a collection of different disciplines of scientific studies on the human nature.</p>
<p>But it is never easy to understand humans despite that we are humans ourselves. When humans gather and form the society, it becomes even more difficult to study the society than individuals. We still know so little about the human society. Even the particular question that how people allocate scarce goods in the society is so poorly understood. Worse, even the much smaller sub-question that how people exchange their goods and share risks in markets is little known. But we are still confident. At least, compared with our predecessors thousands of years ago who could only rely on ox scapulae and turtle plastrons, nowadays we have scientific theories and quantitative methods to study the society.</p>
<p>When I am writing this thesis, I often think of those professional writers on oracle bones. They wrote with knife and ink, whilst I write with computer and \LaTeX. But they and I all write to understand more about the nature and the human society. It is hard to know whether they had ever thought that the logograms they wrote would still be used and their works still be read after millennia. But I am sure many people indeed had thought about why they were writing. So wrote a poet call Cao Pi (187--226 CE), who later became the first emperor of the state of Wei in the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history:</p>
